          p
            | The Touch Events specification defines a set of low-level events that
            | represent one or more points of contact with a touch-sensitive surface,
            | and changes of those points with respect to the surface and any DOM elements
            | displayed upon it (e.g. for touch screens) or associated with it
            | (e.g. for drawing tablets without displays).
